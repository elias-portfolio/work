            So, America, the path that led me here in recent weeks was, no doubt, unexpected. But I’m no stranger to unlikely journeys.
            So, my mother, our mother, Shyamala Harris, had one of her own. And I miss her every day, especially now. We are the heirs
            to the greatest democracy in the history. And on behalf of our children and our grandchildren and all those who sacrificed
            so dearly for our freedom and liberty, we must be worthy of this moment now. We will not go back.

            So we're going to Pennsylvania Avenue, we’re going to the Capitol, and we’re going to try to do it more and give.
            Dems are hopeless; they never vote anything—not even once. But we’re going to try and give our Republicans, the weak ones
            (because strong ones don't need any help), the kind of pride, boldness that they need to take back our country again.
            So let's march and make America great again.
