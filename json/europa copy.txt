458.book on <strong>fire brigade_germany</strong>
In these days, where celebrating the boys in blue might earn you a side-eye and a whispered "fascist," we can always cling to to those dashing, flame-fighting fellows in red instead. Now, one might hope that this pamphlet would cater to our collective fantasy of bare-chested, brawny, and courageous firemen, but alas, no such luck. Instead, it plunges us into the surprisingly unerotic realm of the German fire brigade. 

176.hotel stickers vezprem_hungary
No book ages quite so quickly as a guidebook, which is in fact quite the blessing for the guidebook industry. The same can probably be said of the hotel industry. While these Soviet-styled hotels are long gone in name, their receptions, elevators still exist under the guise of a new system of interconnected hotel booking websites and vacation packages.

184.matchsticks with women and advertising_france
If there’s anything hotter than fire It would have to be softporn that’s also on fire. The entrepreneur behind LES DEUX struck fiery gold when he figured out that nothing creates word by mouth like a curvy blonde clutching driftwood on a beach. 
As Milton Friedman predicted -  once the embers catch, the demand for scandalous blondes on matchboxes becomes an unstoppable wildfire. Hence, marketing campaigns like those at Poierer gas station and Restaurant Pizza Slice emerged, making it nearly impossible to operate a business without the assistance of risqué safety matches.

167.framed photographic model study_germany
Four sun-faded headshots from the golden age of Hollywood give us an insight into the stardom of silent actor Greta Garbo. While two of the images capture the classic three-quarter profile typical of the era, the remaining pair unveil a tender vulnerability of an actress trying different poses and simply doing her best to live up to the expectations set forth by a notoriously unforgiving time in the industry. Looking back at her beauty one can't help but ponder whether it's truly timeless, or if she set the norm of what’s considered good looking today. 

211.waterfall postcards_france
A peculiar collection of photographs pays tribute to the power and beauty of waterfalls. Each image not only highlights the collector's obsession with waterfalls, but also the resourcefulness and entrepreneurial spirit of those who have harnessed the inherent allure of these natural wonders. Creating a livelihood from water smashing against rock through postcards, key rings and screen prints.

157.cut-out incomplete album page_germany
A young girl occupies the heart of three intimately connected moments. The girl's simple, but well-tailored dress and impeccably styled hair, typical of the time, gives us a hint of her upbringing as well as the familial pride behind these staged photographs. This carefully curated presentation can be seen as a playful but serious petit bourgeois staging for a young girl's entrance into a new technological age. Let’s hope she fared better than the book. 

284.two tiny sexy magazines_germany
When does erotica turn into porn? It depends on the lightning.
Taking a page out of Hugh Hefner's playboy magazine, the erotic publications of the 70s often had to come up with additional value propositions like politics or humor. And maybe that was a good thing - some comedy to take the edge of that post nut shame as you leave the magazine in the forest for the next person to enjoy. 

165.fieldpost 1940_austria
During the era before TV antennas and cellular communications, letters written by soldiers serve as a scarce window into the apocalypse that was World War II. For soldiers passing through the valley of the shadow of death, the 23rd Psalm of the bible had a special appeal. Soldiers would often compare passages from the bible with the horrors they witnessed on the battlefield. Maybe they thought it'd be easier for their loved ones to read. Perhaps they were not allowed to tell everything. Regardless of their contents, these letters always convey something, even when they appear to say nothing

414.photo in frame with glass pieces_hungary
On weathered photo paper, encased within a frame of hundreds of small crystal shards stands a proud Hungarian soldier. A downward gaze suggests his unfamiliarity with the camera. The soldier in the photograph may have been captured in his first and last image.

168.gdr mini book_germany
Where would one place this encased book celebrating the GDR's industrial output? We see a woman in a factory, evoking the Soviet hero worker. Beside it, a boat labeled "Lenin" in Cyrillic. A thrilling read? Doubtful. But in the GDR, art's mission was to display a prosperous communist society and secure loyalty. As GDR's Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl stated, "literature and fine arts must be subservient to politics." The book's worn cover and untouched pages hint at its actual purpose: an emblem of loyalty made for a bookcase or coffee table, a testament to the synthesis of art and politics in the GDR.

453.bag with travel documents_belgium
With the advent of charter came red Flemish faces, and their carry-ons were bursting at the seams with last-minute purchases from the airport. This bag of travel documents may have traveled back to Brussels next to an unusually large bottle of Baileys liquor from the duty-free shop, as if to say: "This vacation may be over, but the party has just begun".  The tickets; their badge of honor. After all, they've braved the heat, sand, and masses, emerging victorious as conquerors of the beach. 

409.stereo image woman doing her business_austria
In the summer of 1838, Charles Wheatstone, a British scientist, unveiled an illusion that captured the imagination of many. He demonstrated that by drawing two distinct perspectives of an object and observing each through a different eye, one could perceive a three-dimensional view. Humans then took this breakthrough and turned it into a showcase for our derrieres. A heartwarming reminder that no matter how much time has passed, we humans have always been a bunch of goofballs taking leaks in forests. 

442.collection of polish beer labels_poland
In Western cultures, stages of history are marked by the types of objects people could create. The Paleolithic period derives its name from the crude stone tools in use throughout its long millennia, while the Neolithic period refers to the time when stone was increasingly shaped to conform to users' designs. 
This beer label collection represents a phase in history where the primal collecting drive intersects with the effects of modern labor division. Collections no longer reflect an owner's abilities or assets; instead, they're a result of yesteryear’s brain wiring, a dopaminergic compulsion akin to a sugar craving.

472.round box out of cigarette packages_germany
Humans possess the unique ability to create objects. These creations are not merely survival tools or means to improve comfort; they represent goals, showcase abilities, and shape identities. We are not only Homo sapien but also Homo faber, makers and users of objects. Yet we know little about what objects truly mean to people. Is this cigarette-made round box a nicotine love letter or a display of craftsmanship?
Regardless, the knick-knacks and trinkets accompanying us through life are more than mere playthings or distractions from our inevitable end. They embody our aspirations and serve as testaments to our skills and memories.

232.personal company mug_romania
Selves are everywhere. I myself and you yourself are but two of them. And they are the focus of much of our attention. We talk of self-abasement, self-awareness, self-belief, self-control, self-denial, self-disgust, self-esteem, and of course, selfies. 
The reasons behind this act of self-display may elude us, but one thing remains certain: humans will continue to slap our mugs on mugs.

222.a doghouse and two dags as bottles_austria
An observer from another planet, unacquainted with human ways, might be surprised to learn that our things made for eating, drinking, or pouring, hold such meaning to us. Perhaps it is the vulnerability of these items that makes them important heirlooms passed down through generations. One might ponder how this Austrian pouring kettle got separated from its lineage. Whatever the reason, as humans, we experience countless goodbyes as we make our way through life. Thus, finding an unbroken dish or a whimsical bottle shaped like a dog can offer comfort, reminding us that some things persist despite time's many changes.

174.horserider on matchbox_austria
Often overlooked, the humble matchbox can be seen as a marvel of human ingenuity, the result of our long quest to harness the power of portable flame. Just think about it: it took us humans a million years to come up with a truly portable form of fire! They also serve as a remarkable historical artifact of advertising. Whether this particular matchbox was produced in Austria or merely utilized the image of an Austro-Hungarian soldier for marketing purposes remains a question .


155.collection photo manuals_austria.gif 
The pre-internet era was a time when manuals piled up like skyscrapers in an obsessive hoarder's dream as people had to rely on physical manuals to operate their devices. This often led to collections of bulky instruction booklets, which many held onto for sentimental reasons. And why not? Flipping through the pages to find that perfect flash setting, who in their right mind would give that up? 


407.box with pencils_austria
Back in the day advertisement often featured caricatures of black people, depicting them as foolish or primitive cartoonish stereotypes; a perpetual jester, the butt of the joke. A common device was to use a black boy gleefully enjoying a watermelon, often with a large portion of the food cleverly positioned to form a wide smile on his face. Another typical trope was the image of a "mammy" character, a full-bodied Black woman wearing a headscarf and apron, happily holding a product or serving food to white individuals. Whatever twisted racist logic was behind this pencil is hard to say, and maybe that’s a good thing.


408.early flipbook_austria
Flipsbooks shows us that at its core, cinema is just a sequence of images, a practice as old as art itself. Paleolithic societies crafted sequences of panels that portrayed continuous narratives, including hunting rituals, psychedelic experiences, and historical records. Though perhaps not as accurate as, say, a flipbook capturing the greeting between a man and a lady, these early creations cleverly manipulated rock art, flickering light, and dancing shadows to conjure the illusion of movement. Just like the cave paintings, the true intent behind this flipbook, eludes us. Perhaps it, too, tells us of a psychedelic experience. 

416.photo for gravestone_hungary
Crafted for a gravestone, this portrait could hail from a time when, under the Communist rule in Hungary and surrounding Eastern European nations, the practice of embellishing gravestones with photographs became more widespread. Although this practice existed before, the use of photographs on gravestones became more common during the Communist era, born from the regime's desire to forge a stronger feeling of unity among the proletariat and facilitate a new shared history among its many citizens.

177.illustrated magazine_greece
Helios was a Greek science magazine that extensively employed illustrations to convey scientific ideas. This practice has deep historical roots; for vast periods of time, art served as the sole means for conducting certain types of scientific explorations, such as examining the mysteries of the new world or delving into the intricacies of botany. In retrospect, it can be challenging to distinguish between art and science. Were Muybridge's photographs of animals in motion raw data for physiologists or a form of art? As science progresses, what often endures from these old magazines is the art they contained.

206.trenchart vase_france
Trench art encompasses the unique pieces crafted by soldiers using materials found on the battlefield, such as bullet casing lighters or shrapnel sculptures. American poet Alan Seeger's poem "Maktoob" highlights this art form, recounting how he turned a shell fragment responsible for his friend's death into a ring, which a Muslim soldier then engraved with "maktoob," meaning "it is written." The distinctiveness of trench art lies not only in the materials used but also in its reflection of the diverse cultures of soldiers from around the world, brought together in the trenches for extended durations.

226.early dartboard_holland
The condition of this dartboard from Holland stands as a testament to the impressive upper arm strength of the Dutch people. But this fascinating game was actually conceived across the pond in England, where its residents continuously sought inventive ways to enjoy their frothy beverages and pass the time. In the 1970s, darts briefly faced prohibition in Britain, as it was accused of promoting debauchery.  Amidst this ban, the Dutch darts scene blossomed, spawning legends like Michael van Gerwen who elevated this humble pub diversion to the serious sport it is today.


482.group photo gymnastic team_the netherlands
The impulse to dance existed long before our primate ancestors evolved into humans. Evolutionary biologists suggest that dance was used by early humans to promote the social cooperation essential for our survival. Yet dance could not save this photograph from time. Encased within the time-worn edges of a red wooden frame lies a sun-faded group photograph of a dutch gymnastics team, with a few of them all but erased by the passage of time. Let’s hope that their daily exercise provided them with a resilience that this photograph did not.
