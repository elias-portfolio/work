  <div class="header">EXT. LONDON SCHOOLYARD - DAY</div>
  <div class="action">The scene unfolds against the vibrant and gritty backdrop of London, brick houses lining the streets. Our BOY strolls down the lane, different – no Nuptse, no swagger. Just an invitation for aggro.  As he approaches the schoolyard, he catches the attention of a group of student outside the schoolyard, each sporting a Nuptse like an armor.
Their HEAD HONCHO, spotting our BOY, narrows his eyes in scrutiny.</div>
   
  <div class="dialogue">
    <p class="character">HEAD HONCHO</p>
    <p>Oi, mate. You lost? Dressed like that, you're a right walking target, fam. Where's your protection?</p>
  </div>

  <div class="dialogue">
    <p class="character">BOY WITHOUT JACKET</p>
    <p>Protection against the cold? It's just a bit of chill, innit?</p>
  </div>

   <div class="dialogue">
    <p class="character">HEAD HONCHO</p>
    <p>No, fam! It ain't about the frost; it's the wolves you gotta watch, the bullies! You’re wearing an invitation to an ass-kicking going to school looking like that.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="action">The HEAD HONCHO pauses, taking a deep breath as he surveys the schoolyard, he rubs the back of his neck, a gesture of annoyance mixed with a sense of duty, then locks eyes with our boy.</div>

  <div class="dialogue">
    <p class="character">HEAD HONCHO (CONT'D)</p>
    <p>Ah man, I don't know why I'm doing this, but imma help you out, bro. At this exact moment, you’re a bully’s wet dream. Imagine if a bully sees you without a Nuptse...</p>
  </div>

  <div class="action">CUT TO:</div>
  
  <div class="action">A dynamic, Guy Ritchie-style montage ensues, the camera whipping between subjects with a Guy Ritchie energy. Quick cuts and slick transitions parade the Nuptse jacket in all its glory, we're shown the might of the Nuptse celebrating the diversity in style possible with a nuptse.</div>
  
  <div class="dialogue">
    <p class="character">HEAD HONCHO (V.O. OUT OF FRAME)</p>
    <p>Guy with Nuptse Jacket, guy with Nuptse Jacket, guy without, guy with Nuptse... </p>
  </div>

  <div class="action">As the montage concludes, we return to the group, the BOY is now contemplative.</div>

  <div class="dialogue">
    <p class="character">HEAD HONCHO (CONT'D)</p>
    <p>Now fam, who do you think he’s going to bully?</p>
  </div>

  <div class="dialogue">
    <p class="character">BOY</p>
    <p>The guy with glasses? Or I mean... Mountain-climber-guy. That seems like a weird identity, worthy of bullying, no?</p>
  </div>

  <div class="dialogue">
    <p class="character">HEAD HONCHO</p>
    <p>Let me provide you insight into the mindset of a bully, bro; a bloke with glasses will always have glasses. But you, on the other hand, might not wear that outfit again. That's what bullies live for. They're artists in their own twisted way. And mountain-guy is untouchable, that’s a vintage Nuptse, bro.</p>
  </div>

	<div class="action">The BOY, now aware of the stakes, feels the weight of his vulnerability. Sensing his nervousness the Honcho responds with a hint satisfaction in his voice</div>
  <div class="dialogue">
    <p class="character">HEAD HONCHO</p>
    <p>Don’t worry, fam. I got your back.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="action">In a gesture of solidarity, the HEAD HONCHO throws the BOY a Nuptse jacket in its iconic pocketed form. Now united by Nuptsies the group enters the schoolyard, ready to face whatever comes their way.</div>

  <div class="footer">
    <p class="tagline">Copy: North Face. We got your back.</p>
